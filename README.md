## Overview

Synapse:Connect is a visual programming environment for creating complex animation networks. Build animation graphs using nodes, connect them to create behaviors, and export to game engines.

## Core Modules

### Synapse:Connect
The main application providing a node graph editor for animation authoring:
- **Visual Node Editor** - Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for building animation networks
- **FBX Import** - Load animations, skeletons, and meshes from FBX files
- **Real-time Preview** - See your animation network in action as you build
- **Parameter System** - Control animations with float and vector2 parameters

### Synapse:Runtime (Development Starting Soon)
The runtime animation system that will execute your animation graphs:
- **Efficient Playback** - Optimized animation blending and evaluation (planned)
- **Network Compilation** - Convert node graphs to runtime-ready format (planned)
- **Cross-platform** - Designed for integration with game engines (planned)
- **Status**: Development to begin after core Connect features are stable

### Neuron (Early Development)
Dynamic motion synthesis for procedural animation:
- **Physics-based Animation** - Real-time motion generation
- **COM Balance** (Work in Progress) - Center of mass balancing system
- **Stagger System** (Work in Progress) - Dynamic reactions to impacts
- **Self-preservation** (Work in Progress) - Procedural protective reactions

## Key Features

### Animation Nodes
- **Blend Node** - Mix two animations with weight control
- **Blend2 Node** - Advanced blending with foot sync and time sync options
- **Motion Matching** (Work in Progress) - Database-driven animation selection
- **State Machine** (To be implemented) - Logic-based animation transitions
- **IK Nodes** - Two-bone IK, FABRIK, and aim constraints
- **Additive Blend** - Layer animations on top of base motion

### Specialized Tools
- **Footstep Editor** - Mark and edit foot contact timing
- **Root Motion Extraction** - Extract movement for constant timeline playback, ensuring consistent motion regardless of animation speed
- **Root Trajectory Rendering** - Visualize past and future root motion paths in 3D viewport
- **Timeline Recording** - Evaluate the node graph, then scrub through the recorded timeline to analyze exactly what's happening frame by frame
- **Timeline Editor** - Scrub through animations and edit timing
- **Property Panel** - Fine-tune node parameters

   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

### Dependencies

If you encounter missing library errors, install Qt6:
```bash
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev libqt6widgets6 libqt6opengl6-dev libqt6network6
```

## Getting Started

1. **Launch** - Run `./run.sh` to start Synapse:Connect
2. **Authenticate** - Sign in with your Patreon account (Access Synapse tier required)
3. **Create Project** - File â†’ New Project
4. **Import Animation** - File â†’ Import FBX
5. **Build Network** - Drag nodes from catalog, connect them
6. **Preview** - Hit play to see your animation network in action
7. **Analyze** - Stop playback and scrub the timeline to examine recorded frames

### Authentication

The app uses Patreon OAuth for authentication. On first launch:
- Click "Authenticate with Patreon"
- Log in to your Patreon account
